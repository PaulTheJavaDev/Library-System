Java Library System

Library Management System Overview

Features:
• Add new books to the library.
• List all books with their details (title, author, availability).
• Issue a book to a user (update availability).
• Return a book.
• Search for a book by title or author.
• View all books currently issued.

New Concepts to Explore:
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Learn about encapsulation, inheritance (if needed), and working with multiple classes.
2. File Handling: Use Java's File and Scanner/BufferedReader/ PrintWriter to persist library data.
3. Try-Catch for Exception Handling: Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
4. Generics in ArrayLists: Work with custom data types in ArrayLists.

Some features I might programm, after I am done with the main part:
• Add a command-line login system for librarians and members.
• Integrate sorting and filtering for books (e.g., sort by title or author).
• Trying my hand at JavaX for some graphical interfaces
